# AdventOfCode_2025

Repo of my solutions to this year's puzzles found at https://adventofcode.com/

As usual all of my initial solutions are completely hintless and unassisted other than using a language reference

I don't know the theme I will do for this year

Also good and understandable choice by Eric making it only 12 this year, that makes it a lot more manageable, not every nerd can be doing a degree level problem on Christmas day :)
